      <p class="cs-text">Having an SR22 requirement significantly impacts your car insurance rates in Montana. Because the SR22 designation marks you as a high-risk driver, insurance companies charge higher premiums to offset the increased risk. Maintaining a clean driving record and fulfilling the SR22 requirement without incidents can eventually help reduce your rates.</p>
